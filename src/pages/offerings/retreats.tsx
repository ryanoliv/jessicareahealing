              An alchemical awakening journey through of our senses. We explore
              many essences, foods, sounds, energies and textures in this
              exploration. The core of this workshop is to bring in the
              understanding of how sensitive we truly are and allow those to
              walk away from this workshop with tools to harness their
              sensitivity. We spend most of our time as humans distracting or
              occupying these senses through vices. This workshop is curated to
              awaken how we are able to truly connect back to self. Allowing us
              to understand how to rest the nervous system and harness our true
              sensitivity.

            <p>
              Our senses are what allow us to interact and feel. So by learning
              how to harness our own power and sensitivity we are able to
              empower ourselves to navigate any moods or resistance to change
              that arrises.
