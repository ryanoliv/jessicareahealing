              Embark on an alchemical awakening journey through our senses with
              our workshop, &quot;Let&apos;s Get Sensual.&quot; In this
              exploration, we delve into various essences, foods, sounds,
              energies, and textures to awaken our senses and deepen our
              connection with self. The core purpose of this workshop is to
              bring awareness to our innate sensitivity and provide participants
              with practical tools to harness and honor their own sensitivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As humans, we often distract or occupy our senses through various
              vices, but this workshop is designed to awaken our ability to
              truly connect back to ourselves, allowing us to rest our nervous
              systems and embrace our true sensitivity. Our senses are the
              portals through which we interact with the world and experience
              life. By learning how to harness our own power and sensitivity, we
              empower ourselves to navigate any mood or resistance to change
              that may arise.
