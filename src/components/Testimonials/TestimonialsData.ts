      "I experienced strong physical and mental shifts both during the session and after. Since then I have been so much more aware of myself and my surroundings. I feel more in tune with myself and my actions, being able to be more present as well as finding a lot more time to be still.",

      "I have had the pleasure of experiencing a reiki session with Jess and it was nothing short of spectacular. She has the warmest soul and creates such a safe space for all her clients. Although I consider her a friend, she was so professional - I have truly been feeling so much lighter, happier and more positive since our session. I highly recommend her to anyone who is feeling stuck, has anxiety, needs comfort, a mood lifter, connection to self, a fresh healthy flow of energy and/or a general healing of health and well-being!",

      "I am beyond grateful that Jess has introduced reiki into my life. I was initially a little sceptical and not 100% convinced of the benefits or how much of an impact a few reiki sessions could have on me but I decided to give it a chance last year March as I was curious, and I‚Äôm so glad I did! After just the first session I felt calmer and more level-headed. Every session after that built on that initial experience and got better and better. I felt more focused, less anxious, and more productive in my day to day. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I was free to carry out my daily responsibilities without anything holding me back. I also felt I could connect with others easier as I felt more present and less in my head and anxious. Jess is extremely professional and knows how to create a safe space for her clients so that they feel they can just be themselves and relax. She is warm and empathetic, and lovingly welcomes you into her peaceful and ambient space which immediately evokes a sense of calm, and through a brief discussion helps you to hone in on a specific intention to focus on throughout the session. I highly recommend not only reiki, but also Jess in particular, to anyone considering embarking on this journey! Absolutely everyone can benefit enormously from a regular reiki practice.",

      "I went to Jess for three incredibly transformative reiki sessions. Jess held space so beautifully and resorted my energy from a place of depletion to a place of hope and growth. Her gentle yet firm presence made me feel vulnerable enough to open up and let go, whilst still focusing on my own innate power to heal and grow. She planted seeds of expansion where I felt so stuck. She made me believe in myself, in the power of subtle energy, and in the power to change and grow. I feel that Jess is an extremely special soul who came to Earth with a purpose- to invite others to heal themselves and she is practicing this through her beautiful reiki sessions. Jess, I can't thank you enough for the love and healing that you poured into my body and mind. It was felt and treasured and carried me when I needed it most. Thank you. ‚ô•Ô∏èüôè",

      "I was very fortunate enough to catch Jess when she was visiting Cape Town for a few months and decided to open up a Reiki studio and offer Reiki sessions part time for a few months during her stay. I was going through one of the hardest changes in my life and really struggling to adapt and move forward with things.. Jess reached out and introduced me to reiki. I experienced two reiki healing sessions with her and found them very powerful and emotional. After each session I felt a deep sense of relaxation and calmness due to her beautiful energy and reiki magic as well as more ‚Äòlight‚Äô in my head and emotions. After the first session the following day I was very emotionally and cried quite a lot which helped with releasing and letting go of what I was struggling to come to terms with. I definitely think if Jessica had stayed in Cape Town I would have loved to have carried on with reiki with her as I think it really would have helped my emotional state and help delve in and release past traumas, including childhood ones that we only identify later on in life‚Ä¶ Jessica is also amazing to chat to and so wise. She‚Äôs got kind and gentle energy and I think she makes the most wonderful reiki healer. I highly recommend booking a session with her and giving reiki a try!",

      "I have had the honor to experience many different healing modalities throughout my life, however I had never experienced Reiki until I found Jess. It is hard for me to completely open up to healers, yet I felt very comfortable under Jess's hands. I went for a weekly session, over a month, and It was an hour every week that I was able to release, let go and give myself a moment of self love. In today's stressful world, it's hard to have a complete break from the chaos and so, just that one hour with Jess was enough time to reboot, and re-energize. I was able to shift stagnant energy and relieve emotional stress that had built up and was stored in my body. I couldn't recommend Reiki more, to anyone who is in need of a moment of self, a moment of breath and a moment of connection, to your spiritial being.",

      "There was a time I had a certain discomfort in my life. I was having an eye tick/twitch and unsure what the cause was. I spoke to a Jessica about it and she recommended a Crystal healing. It was an outstanding experience and it took a few days and my eye had stopped twitching and I was already experiencing the incredible outcomes.",

      "My reiki session with Jessica was something I will never forget as it was the first time I was truly aware of my energy before and after a session. Having not done many reiki session in my lifetime I was sure to set a specific intention which was set to help me relive myself of a creative block I‚Äôd been struggling with. Her work allowed myself and my space to be free of my block. It is a pretty indescribable feeling, especially when your personal knowledge is not in depth on the healing process. It also relived some pain caused by an autoimmune which was an added bonus and something I may not have been aware was connected to my block if I had not been open to the session. I recommend anyone to open yourself up to Jess and her work.",
